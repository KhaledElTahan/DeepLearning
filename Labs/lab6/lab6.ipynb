        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",

        "1.   In many cases, games have perfectly describable environments. For example, all rules of chess can be formally written and programmed into a chess game simulator;\n",
        "2.   Games are massively parallelizable. Since they do not require running in the real world, simultaneous environments can be run on large data clusters; \n",
        "3.   Simpler scenarios in games enable fast prototyping. This speeds up the development of algorithms that could eventually run in the real-world; and\n",

Reinforcement learning is fundamentally different, in that we are training a deep learning algorithm to govern the actions of our RL agent, that is trying, within its environment, to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. The goal of training an RL agent is to determine the best next step to take to earn the greatest final payoff or return.

To access the Cartpole environment, we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`, which we gained access to when we imported the `gym` package.

Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time."

        "Now we can start to define the learing algorithm which will be used to reinforce good behaviors of the agent and discourage bad behaviours. In this lab, we will focus on *policy gradient* methods which aim to **maximize** the likelihood of actions that result in large rewards. Equivalently, this means that we want to **minimize** the negative likelihood of these same actions. We achieve this by simply **scaling** (aka multiplying) the probabilities by their associated rewards -- effectively amplifying the likelihood of actions that result in large rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the log function is monotonically increasing, this means that minimizing **negative likelihood** is equivalent to minimizing **negative log-likelihood**.  Recall that we can easily compute the negative log-likelihood of a discrete action by evaluting its [softmax cross entropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits). Like in supervised learning, we can use stochastic gradient descent methods to achieve the desired minimization. \n",
